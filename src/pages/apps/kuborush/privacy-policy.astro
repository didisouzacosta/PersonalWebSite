            <h4>Last updated: 16/01/2026</h4>

            <p>
                The KuboRush game respects your privacy and is committed to being
                transparent about how your information is handled.
            </p>

            <h3>1. No Personal Data Collection</h3>

            <p>
                KuboRush does not collect, store, or request any personal data that could
                identify or characterize the user (such as name, email, phone number,
                photos, or location).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>We do not use your data for advertising purposes.</strong> No
                registration is required to play the game, and we do not build user
                profiles for ad targeting.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Error Tracking and Optimization</h3>

            <p>
                We use Firebase (a Google service) solely to track technical errors and
                optimize game performance. We collect anonymous data to understand:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Information about why and when the game
                    crashed or froze, helping us fix bugs effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gameplay Performance:</strong> Anonymous metrics on level
                    difficulty and feature usage to optimize the gaming experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Technical Details:</strong> Basic device information such as
                    device model, operating system version, and region (for language
                    settings).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This data is collected strictly for statistical and technical maintenance
                purposes. None of this information allows us to individually identify the
                user.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Data Sharing</h3>

            <p>
                The information collected anonymously is processed via Google’s analysis
                services (Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics), in accordance with their
                own privacy policies:
                <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                We do not share data with third parties for marketing, advertising, or
                commercial purposes. The data is used exclusively by the development team
                to improve KuboRush.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Security</h3>

            <p>
                Although the game does not collect personal data, we apply strictly good
                security practices to protect the anonymous technical information
                collected via Firebase.
            </p>

            <h3>5. User Rights</h3>

            <p>
                Since we do not collect personal data or require user accounts, we do not
                store information that would allow specific access, modification, or
                deletion requests by a named individual.
            </p>
            <p>
                If desired, the user may limit the collection of anonymous data by
                adjusting their device’s system privacy settings.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Changes to This Policy</h3>

            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect technical
                updates or changes in our practices. Significant changes will be
                communicated within the game description or on our official website.
            </p>
