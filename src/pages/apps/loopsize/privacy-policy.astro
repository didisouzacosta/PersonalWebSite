                <h4>Last updated: 08/19/2025</h4>

                <p>The LoopSize application respects your privacy and is committed to being transparent about how your information is handled.</p>

                <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>

                <p>LoopSize does not collect, store, or request any personal data that could identify or characterize the user (such as name, email, phone number, location, etc.).
                No registration is required to use the application.</p>

                <h3>2. Usage Data</h3>

                <p>We use Firebase Analytics (a Google service) to anonymously track certain interactions within the application, such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Features accessed;</li>
                    <li>Frequency of use;</li>
                    <li>Basic technical information (such as device model, operating system version, and language).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This data is collected solely for statistical purposes and helps improve the user experience in the application.
                None of this information allows us to individually identify the user.</p>

                <h3>3. Data Sharing</h3>

                <p>The information collected anonymously may be shared only with Google’s analysis services (Firebase), in accordance with their own privacy policies:
                <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></p>

                <p>We do not share data with third parties for direct marketing purposes or for selling information.</p>

                <h3>4. Security</h3>

                <p>Although the application does not collect personal data, we apply good security practices to protect the anonymous usage information collected via Firebase.</p>

                <h3>5. User Rights</h3>

                <p>Since we do not collect personal data, we do not store information that would allow access, modification, or deletion by the user.</p>
                <p>If desired, the user may limit or disable the collection of anonymous data by adjusting their device’s privacy settings (such as resetting the advertising ID).</p>

                <h3>6. Changes to This Policy</h3>

                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant changes will be communicated within the application or on our official website.</p>
